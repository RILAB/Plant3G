- [Chunk Options](#chunk_options)
- [Package Options](#package_options)

The **Plant3G** package shares most options with Sweave, but some were
dropped/changed and some new options were added. The default values are in
the parentheses below. Note that the chunk label for each chunk is assumed
to be unique, i.e., no two chunks share the same label. This is especially
important for cache and plot filenames. Chunks without labels will be
assigned labels like `unnamed-chunk-i` where `i` is the chunk number.
