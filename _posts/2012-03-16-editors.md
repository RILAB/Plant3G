I have written about [LyX](../lyx/), [RStudio](../rstudio/), [Emacs Org-mode](../org/) and [Eclipse](../eclipse/). There are still other editors that we can use with **knitr**, such as [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) and WinEdt. The key is that you call R and load the **knitr** package, then call the function `knit()` or `knit2pdf()`.

## Texmaker

You can define a custom command to process Rnw documents by `User --> User Commands --> Edit User Commands`:

Note if you have not added R's bin path to the `PATH` variable, you need to use the full path to `Rscript.exe` in the above command like:

    "C:/Program Files/R/R-2.14.2/bin/Rscript.exe" -e "knitr::knit2pdf('%.Rnw')"

If you do know where is `Rscript.exe`, simply open R and use `R.home('bin')` to find it. Then for an Rnw document, you can use this `knitr` command to compile it:

![Compile Rnw in Texmaker with knitr](http://i.imgur.com/xKoeT.png)

Click the arrow on the left to compile the document, and the right arrow to view PDF. Of course the above configuration is for Windows, but it is straightforward for other systems as well: change `Rscript.exe` to `Rscript` (in fact you can use `Rscript` under Windows as well).

## TeXStudio

It is basically the same thing as Texmaker (thanks, Henrik Nyhus):

## WinEdt

The WinEdt mode [R-Sweave](http://www.winedt.org/Config/modes/R-Sweave.php) supports **knitr** now. Please read on if you want to configure WinEdt by yourself instead.

The following instructions were from [Phil Chalmers](https://github.com/philchalmers), and I did not test them at all, but I feel it should be in the ballpark.

1. Go to `Options -> Execution Modes -> PDFTeXify`. Then look for executable `Rscript.exe` (e.g. `C:\Program Files\R\R-2.14.2\bin\Rscript.exe`) and select that.
2. under `Switches` put `-e`, and under `Parameters` put `"knitr::knit2pdf('%n%t')"`

Now hitting `F9` will run everything for you at once, including opening up the PDF.

Thanks, Phil.

## Emacs/ESS

Since 12.09, **knitr** has been officially supported in [ESS](http://ess.r-project.org). If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, you can install it by

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install ess
{% endhighlight %}

Below is a short video showing how to use **knitr** in ESS:

(For historic interest only) Both [Simon Potter](http://sjp.co.nz/posts/emacs-ess-knitr/) and [lucialam](https://constantmindmapping.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/knitr-and-emacs/) have blog posts about Emacs/**knitr**.

## Gedit

You can define external tools in [gedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit). Thanks to the tip from David Allen below, you may knit a document via

```bash
Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit('$GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_NAME')"
```

## Sublime

The [KnitrSublime](https://github.com/andrewheiss/KnitrSublime) package by Andrew Heiss provides very rudimentary LaTeX support for **knitr** in Sublime Text 2.

## Vim

The [Vim-R-Plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628) has comprehensive support to **knitr** thanks to Jakson Aquino.

## TextMate

See [#252](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/252#issuecomment-6034068) for one approach with Applescript for TextMate 2, and the [knitr.tmbundle](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/knitr.tmbundle) repository by Chris Fonnesbeck.

## TeXShop

It is easy to configure [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) to work with **knitr**; just save the code below as a file `Knitr.engine` under the `Engines` directory of TeXShop (usually `~/Library/TeXShop/Engines/`):

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/texbin:/usr/local/bin
Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit('$1')"
latexmk -pdf "${1%.*}"
{% endhighlight %}

## TeXworks

TeXworks is similar to Texmaker in terms of configuration for additional tools. Below is a screenshot of the configuration under Ubuntu, thanks to [Speravir](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/85165/9128) for the answer on StackExchange (Windows/Mac OS should be similar, as long as `Rscript` is in `PATH`).

## Kile

The following method was pointed out by tirip01 in the comments below:

1. Open the `Build` tab, select `New..`, type `knitr` and press `Finish`. In the `General` tab enter `Rscript` in the `Command` field. Below, in the `Options` field type: `-e "knitr::knit2pdf('%source')"`

1. Go to `Advanced` tab and set Rnw as `Source extension` and pdf as `Target extension`.

1. In menu select `Compile`

Dr Marek GÄ…golewski also has a blog post [Configure Kile for knitr under GNU/Linux](http://www.rexamine.com/2013/04/configure-kile-for-knitr/), which describes a more complicated approach.

## Tinn-R

Tinn-R started to support **knitr** since v2.3.7.3.
