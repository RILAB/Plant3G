The package manual itself can be a good example demonstrating most of the features in **knitr**. It was actually written in LyX ([knitr-manual.lyx](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-manual.lyx)), and you can use the exported Rnw source [knitr-manual.Rnw](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-manual.Rnw) to produce the PDF output [knitr-manual.pdf](https://bitbucket.org/stat/knitr/downloads/knitr-manual.pdf).

Three add-on packages are required to compile the manual: **rgl**, **animation** and **tikzDevice**.

See the [LyX page](/knitr/demo/lyx/) for instructions on how to use **knitr** with LyX.
