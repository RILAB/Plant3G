By default, **knitr** uses a LaTeX package named [framed](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/framed) for typesetting; the most obvious feature is the light gray shading. In this page, we introduce some tricks and known problems.

As listed in [FAQ's](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/FAQ.md), you may see the output overflow the shading box, and you can set `options('width')` to a smaller value in this case.

## Overflow of elements

Besides text overflow, figures may also exceed the margin of the shading. If a figure is too wide, LaTeX may complain there is something wrong with the `kframe` environment, which is what **knitr** uses to wrap up the chunk output. A known case is about PNG graphics in [#154](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/154). To make sure your figures do not exceed the page margin, **knitr** uses the following command in the LaTeX preamble:

{% highlight tex %}
%% maxwidth is the original width if it's less than linewidth
%% otherwise use linewidth (to make sure the graphics do not exceed the margin)
\makeatletter
\def\maxwidth{ %
  \ifdim\Gin@nat@width>\linewidth
    \linewidth
  \else
    \Gin@nat@width
  \fi
}
\makeatother
{% endhighlight %}

The chunk option `out.width` is set to `'\\maxwidth'` by default if the output format is LaTeX.

## Padding of the shading box

This LaTeX command sets the padding to be 5mm if you feel the default layout is too parsimonious (no padding at all).

{% highlight tex %}
\setlength\fboxsep{5mm}
{% endhighlight %}

If you do not like this default style with the **framed** package, you are free to switch to other styles like [listings](../listings/) or even define your own output [hooks](/knitr/hooks).

## Incompatible environments with **framed**

It does not work well with the `figure*` environment in two-column documents; see [knitr-twocolumn.pdf](https://bitbucket.org/stat/knitr/downloads/knitr-twocolumn.pdf) for one approach to deal with this situation.

If you use the Tufte handout/book classes, the `fullwidth` environment does not work well with the **framed** package either; see discussion in [#222](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/222) for possible solutions.

It does not work with the **lineno** package; see [Michael's post](http://groups.google.com/group/knitr/browse_thread/thread/b0d6723386371139) in the mailing list.
